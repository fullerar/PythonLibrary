# 🐍 Python Project Collection

A personal collection of small Python projects and scripts — each in its own folder with its own README and purpose. This repo serves as a sandbox for experimentation, fun, and learning.

---

## 📁 Structure

Each subfolder contains a self-contained mini-project:

```bash
/
├── GottaGoFast/        # Speed reading GUI using tkinter
│   └── README.md
├── SomeOtherProject/   # Placeholder for your next cool idea
│   └── README.md
├── AnotherTool/        # Utility script or small tool
│   └── README.md
└── ...                # More to come!
```

Each folder includes its own README and instructions.
