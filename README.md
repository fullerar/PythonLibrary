# PythonLibrary
A collection of Python scripts that do various individual tasks. More so fun small projects to tinker with.

GottaGoFast
  Usage:
  - python GottaGoFast.py <path/to/text.txt>

  About:
  - Singular script that reads in a text file (idealy a book, which you can find many for free on https://www.gutenberg.org/).
  - Script then opens a simple GUI will start displaying one word at a time, starting from the first word in the text file.
  - The middle letter of each word will be highlighted red in order to help keep your eyes focused.
  - Once focused, you may try increasing the speed at which the words are displayed. 10ms-1000ms.
  - This allows you to speed read large sections of text. The trick is to retain the words read, but that you will have to work on on your own.

  DISCLAIMER: A copy of Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Caroll is included in this folder simply for demonstration purposes, which was downloaded from https://www.gutenberg.org/. I do not claim ownership of any work that is found in that text file.
