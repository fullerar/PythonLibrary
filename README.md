A copy of *Alice in Wonderland* by Lewis Carroll is included for demonstration purposes. It was sourced from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) — a fantastic place to find free public domain books.

📌 **Disclaimer**: I do not claim ownership of any text from the included book file. It is provided solely for testing and educational use.
